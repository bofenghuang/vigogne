*The vigogne (French name for vicuÃ±a) is a South American camelid native to the Andes Mountains. It is closely related to the llama, alpaca, and guanaco.*

Vigogne is a collection of powerful ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French large language models (LLMs) that are open-source and designed for instruction-following and chat purposes.

The main contributions of this project include:

- Open-sourced ðŸ¦™ Vigogne models for French instruction-following and chat
- Efficient training code for fine-tuning LLMs such as [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [Llama-2](https://ai.meta.com/llama), [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae), and [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl)
- Generated, translated, and collected French instruction-following and dialogue datasets, along with the used scripts
- Inference code, Gradio demo, and support for deploying within various libraries such as ðŸ¤— [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), and [vLLM](https://vllm.ai)
- Support diverse application ecosystems, including [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bofenghuang/vigogne.git
cd vigogne
```

2. Install the package

```bash
# Install DeepSpeed if want to accelerate training with it
pip install deepspeed

# Install FlashAttention to further speed up training and reduce memory usage (essential for long sequences)
pip install packaging ninja
# For FlashAttention 1
# pip install --no-build-isolation flash-attn<2
# For FlashAttention 2
# Might takes 3-5 minutes on a 64-core machine
pip install --no-build-isolation flash-attn

pip install .
```

## ðŸ¦™ Vigogne Models

The fine-tuned ðŸ¦™ Vigogne models come in two types: **instruction-following models** and **chat models**. The instruction-following models are optimized to generate concise and helpful responses to user instructions, similar to `text-davinci-003`. Meanwhile, the chat models are designed for multi-turn dialogues, but they also perform well in instruction-following tasks, similar to `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

More information can be found in [vigogne/model](docs/model.md).

## Inference and Deployment

This repository offers multiple options for inference and deployment, including Google Colab notebooks, Gradio demos, [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), and [vLLM](https://vllm.ai). It also offers guidance on conducting experiments using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) on your personal computer.

More information can be found in [vigogne/inference](docs/inference.md).

## Application

This repository provides integration examples for incorporating Vigogne models into diverse application ecosystems, including [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).

More information can be found in [vigogne/application](docs/application.md).

## Data

The Vigogne models were trained on a variety of datasets, including open-source datasets, ChatGPT-distillation datasets (self-instruct, self-chat, and orca-style data), and translated datasets.

More information can be found in [vigogne/data](docs/data.md).

## Training

The Vigogne models were mostly instruction fine-tuned from other foundation models.

More information can be found in [vigogne/training](docs/training.md).

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Vigogne is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed. Please note that it is possible that the model generates harmful or biased content, incorrect information or generally unhelpful answers.
